Lab 1 - Show list of files
#########

1.
Create a new controller that will show the list of
files in the project's root directory

Mapping should be:

get '/files' => 'files#index'

For each file show its name and its size


2. NOTE: It uses things we haven't yet learned

Allow users to "click" on each text file
(which ends in .txt) to see its contents

(Think - what should be the route name?
         what should be the action name?
)

3. Add two buttons "Delete" and "Duplicate"
   next to each file in the list

   Delete - should delete the file
   Duplicate - should duplicate the file
